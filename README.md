[Practical 2: MPI setup and sample code](practical2/doc/practical2.pdf)
Setup MPI and execute sample code given in MPI src.

Write steps for MPI setup. List problem observed during setup and execution . Specify cause and solution of each problem. 

Code should have following  basic functions:

1. print Computer machine name and rank id for each process.

2. MPI time function to measure time taken by given fragment.

3. Communication function (send/receive, scatter, broadcast etc.)

4. Find command to set fix process per node.
